# dockerWordpress

Build a Docker host for Wordpress either on VirtualBox (local) or DigitalOcean (cloud) and shuttle complete WordPress sites between hosts

The scripts in this repository are configured for specific versions of various software components. 

As these dependencies all change over time, some stuff will no doubt break.

I've attempted to make all code readable so any necessary updates or fixes would hopefully be easy to figure out.
